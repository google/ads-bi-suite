| Product    | Resource                          | Notes                                                                      |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Google Ads | MCC account ID                    | The top MCC account contains all the Ads accounts for reporting.           |
| Google Ads | Developer token                   | Check the access level. Should be [Standard access].                       |
| Google Ads | User account                      | Grant access to Google Ads accounts through OAuth during the installation. |
| GCP        | Billed GCP project ID             | This GCP shouldn’t engage with any other Google Ads developer token.       |
| GCP        | User account                      | Login in GCP and install the solution, ideally the 'owner'.                |
| GCP        | OAuth client ID and client secret | The OAuth application’s type should be ‘Desktop app’.                      |
| Other      | Google account                    | **Needs to be submitted before installation to be grant access.**          |

[standard access]: https://developers.google.com/adwords/api/docs/access-levels#access_levels

### 2.2. Check out source codes

1. Open the [Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/)
2. Fellow this [instructions](https://g3doc.corp.google.com/company/teams/gtech/ads/das/cse/faq/tools/professional-services-googlesource-com.md#working-from-gcp) to clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://professional-services.googlesource.com/solutions/ads-bi-suite
   ```

### 2.3. Run install script

Run the deployment scrip, and follow the prompt to enter your client id,
client secret, Google Ads developer token, and mcc id.

```shell
cd ads-bi-suite; chmod a+x deploy.sh; ./deploy.sh
```

### 2.4. Possible extra tasks during installation

#### 2.4.1. Initialize Firestore

If the GCP hasn't got the Firestore (Datastore) initialized, during the
installation, the script will print a link and ask you to create Firestore in
the opened page before continue. The prompt looks like this:

```shell
Cannot find Firestore or Datastore in current project. Please visit
https://console.cloud.google.com/firestore?project=[YOUR_PROJECT_ID] to
create a database before continue.

Press any key to continue after you create the database...
```

## 3. Release

bi-weekly. The detail features/bugs between each release version are documented
in [go/lego-release-note](go/lego-release-note).
